- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PrivacyStan

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in password generators and other security and privacy related tech. 

- ðŸ‘€ I'm also searching for data collaboration tools that will let me control a data set but also 
--- 1) allow approved contributors to make changes 
--- 2) allow general public to suggest changes 
--- 3) keep a complete audit trail with the ability to rollback committs

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a privacy expert who focuses on datasets, an entreprenenur, and a former developer who just doesn't have the pateince to write code any longer

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at jeff at privacyplan.net or @privacy_stan on twitter
